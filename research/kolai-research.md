# KOL.ai - AI Micro-Influencer Marketplace

## One-liner
Match Thai brands with micro-influencers using AI — automatically find, vet, negotiate, and track campaigns at scale.

## Why This Sparks Joy
Influencer marketing in Thailand: $500M+ market. Brands spend 40+ hours per campaign on discovery, vetting, negotiation. Micro-influencers (10K-100K followers) have 6x higher engagement than celebrities but are hard to find. KOL.ai automates the entire process: AI finds matching influencers, predicts campaign ROI, auto-negotiates rates, tracks performance. First AI-powered Thai influencer marketplace.
