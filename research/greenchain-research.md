# GreenChain Thailand - Carbon Credit Blockchain

## One-liner
Tokenize Thai farmers' carbon sequestration on blockchain — verified by satellite, sold to global corporates as premium carbon credits.

## Why This Sparks Joy
Thailand has 23M rai of agricultural land. Global carbon credit market hitting $100B by 2030. Thai farmers earn $0 from carbon today. Verra verification takes 2+ years and costs $50K+. GreenChain uses satellite data + local validators to slash verification to 2 months at $5K. First-mover in Thai agricultural carbon tokenization.

## Market Evidence
- Global carbon credits: $100B by 2030
- Thailand: 23M rai agricultural land
- Verra verification: 2+ years, $50K+
- Microsoft bought 1.5M tons in 2022
- EU CBAM driving demand for verified credits
- Thai government T-VER program underutilized

## Competitors
- Verra (slow, expensive, global)
- Gold Standard (same issues)
- Toucan Protocol (no Thai focus)
- No local competitor tokenizing Thai agricultural carbon

## Revenue Model
- 5% of carbon credit sales (farmers keep 95%)
- $500/verification (satellite + ground truth)
- Enterprise subscription for credit buyers: $999/mo
- Premium verified Thai carbon: $20-30/ton (vs generic $8-12)

## Path to $1M ARR
- Year 1: 50,000 rai tokenized = 500,000 tons
- Year 2: 200,000 rai = 2M tons
- Revenue: 5% of 2M tons × $20 = $2M gross, $1M net

## AI Role (Sun)
Orchestrates satellite data analysis, automates verification reports, manages carbon credit marketplace, buyer-seller matching.

## Thanapat Role
Government relations (T-VER integration), corporate buyer partnerships, UN climate conference presence.

## Why NOW
1. EU CBAM creates massive corporate demand
2. Satellite + AI makes verification affordable
3. Thai T-VER framework exists but underused
4. No local blockchain carbon player

## Risks
- Carbon price volatility
- Regulatory changes
- Verification disputes
- Farmer adoption friction

## Scores
- Spark Joy: 6/10
- Thanapat Fit: 10/10 (blockchain + climate = perfect match)
