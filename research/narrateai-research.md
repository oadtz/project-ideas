# NarrateAI - Thai Text-to-Podcast

## One-liner
Turn any Thai article into a natural-sounding podcast — YOUR voice, cloned once, used forever across all content.

## Why This Sparks Joy
Thailand has 70M+ people consuming content primarily in Thai. Podcasts growing 25% YoY. But creating Thai audio content is expensive — professional narrators cost $50-100/hour. NarrateAI clones your voice once ($49), then generates unlimited podcasts, audiobooks, and narrations. Text-to-speech in Thai was terrible until 2024 — now AI voice quality crossed the uncanny valley.
