# QueryBrain - Thai NL-to-SQL BI

## One-liner
Ask questions in Thai, get instant SQL + charts — no coding required. "แสดงยอดขายเดือนนี้ตามจังหวัด" → query runs → dashboard appears.

## Why This Sparks Joy
Thai SMBs have data in databases but no one to query it. Hiring a data analyst costs $1,500-3,000/month. SQL is too technical for business owners. QueryBrain lets ANY Thai business owner ask questions in natural Thai and get instant visualizations. Democratizes business intelligence for Thailand's 3M+ SMEs.

## Market Evidence
