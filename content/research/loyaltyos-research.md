# LoyaltyOS - Web3 Loyalty for Thai Brands

## One-liner
Turn loyalty points into tradeable NFTs — users can sell, gift, or combine points from different brands on one platform.

## Why This Sparks Joy
Thai loyalty programs are fragmented — 7-Eleven, Central, Airlines, gas stations — all siloed. 90% of points expire unused. Users can't combine or transfer. Web3 enables: portable points, secondary market trading, cross-brand rewards. First-mover in Thai Web3 loyalty infrastructure. Thanapat's blockchain DNA is perfect fit.

## Market Evidence
- Thai loyalty market: $2B+ in unredeemed points
- Average Thai in 5+ loyalty programs
- 90% of points expire unused
- Starbucks Odyssey (US) proved NFT loyalty works
- Thai brands experimenting with NFTs (limited success due to no unified platform)

## Competitors
- Traditional: The 1 (Central), Pao Tang (government)
- Web3: None in Thailand
- Global: Guild.xyz, Galxe (no Thai focus)
- No Thai Web3 loyalty aggregator

## Revenue Model
- Setup fee: $2,999 per brand
- Transaction fee: 2% on point trades
- Monthly SaaS: $299/brand
- Premium analytics: $199/mo

## Path to $1M ARR
- Month 6: 20 brands = $60K setup + $60K MRR
- Month 12: 50 brands = $150K MRR + trading fees
- Month 18: 100 brands = $300K MRR + trading = $1M ARR

## AI Role (Sun)
Smart contract deployment, point valuation AI, cross-brand reward matching, fraud detection.

## Thanapat Role
Brand partnerships (use Central/7-Eleven connections), blockchain architecture, investor narrative for Web3 loyalty.

## Why NOW
1. Web3 infrastructure mature (Polygon, cheap gas)
2. Brands experimenting but failing solo
3. No aggregator exists
4. Points expire = consumer pain = opportunity

## Risks
- Web3 adoption friction for mass market
- Regulatory uncertainty
- Brand cannibalization fears
- Technical complexity for non-crypto users

## Scores
- Spark Joy: 7/10
- Thanapat Fit: 9/10 (blockchain + Thailand = perfect)
