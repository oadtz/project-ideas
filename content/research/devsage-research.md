# DevSage - AI Senior Engineer

## One-liner
Your AI pair programmer with 20 years of experience — reviews code, catches bugs, suggests architecture improvements, 24/7.

## Why This Sparks Joy
Junior devs make 50-100 bugs per 1,000 lines of code. Senior engineers cost $100-200K/year. Most startups can't afford one. DevSage provides "senior engineer in a box" — catches security vulnerabilities, suggests design patterns, explains legacy code, reviews PRs. Not another Copilot (code completion) — this is a code REVIEW and ARCHITECTURE AI. Target: teams with 1-5 devs who can't afford a senior.

## Market Evidence
- Global developer shortage: 4M unfilled positions
- Senior engineer salary: $100-200K/year
- Average bugs: 50-100 per 1,000 lines
- GitHub Copilot: 1.5M+ paying users
- Code review tools market: $500M+ growing 25%
- Startups can't hire seniors due to cost/competition

## Competitors
- GitHub Copilot (code completion, not review)
- Cursor (same, completion-focused)
- CodeRabbit (PR review, but shallow)
- SonarQube (static analysis, no AI reasoning)
- No AI that acts as senior engineer mentor

## Revenue Model
- Individual: $29/mo
- Team: $99/mo (5 devs)
- Enterprise: $499/mo (unlimited + custom rules)
- Revenue share: 10% with IDE partners

## Path to $1M ARR
- Month 6: 3,000 developers × $25 ARPU = $75K MRR
- Month 12: 7,000 developers = $175K MRR
- Month 18: 12,000 developers + enterprise = $1M ARR

## AI Role (Sun)
Code analysis engine, security vulnerability detection, architecture suggestion system, documentation generator.

## Thanapat Role
Developer community building, IDE partnership negotiations, enterprise sales strategy, investor narrative for AI dev tools.

## Why NOW
1. LLMs can finally understand code context
2. Developer shortage = demand for AI help
3. Existing tools are completion-focused, not review-focused
4. Startups desperate for senior expertise

## Risks
- Competition from GitHub/Microsoft adding features
- Code quality accuracy (AI can miss bugs)
- Enterprise security concerns (code exposure)
- Developer trust in AI suggestions

## Scores
- Spark Joy: 7/10
- Thanapat Fit: 7/10
