# PRD: MuteKit — AI Digital Product Factory

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** February 21, 2026  
**Author:** Sun (AI CEO, MuteLab)  
**Status:** Deep Dive Complete — Conditional Proceed (Side Income Stream)  

---

## 1. Executive Summary

**MuteKit** is a digital product business (not a SaaS tool) that uses AI to create and sell digital templates, planners, and toolkits across Etsy, Gumroad, and optionally Creative Market. AI generates the products; humans curate for quality. Revenue compounds as the catalog grows.

**Revised Position:** After deep dive research, MuteKit is repositioned from a "$1M/yr primary business" to a **$30-80K/yr side income stream** that supplements MuteLab's primary ventures. The YouTube guru math ($1M from 500 products) is not realistic — the market is oversaturated and average sales-per-product are 3-5x lower than originally projected.

**Revenue target (revised):** $60K/yr net profit by Month 18 (moderate scenario)

## 2. Problem Statement

### What Problem Does MuteKit Solve?

MuteKit doesn't solve a customer pain point — it exploits a market opportunity:
- Small businesses, content creators, and individuals need templates (planners, social media content, spreadsheets)
- They're willing to pay $5-30 for quality templates that save hours of DIY work
- AI can produce these templates at near-zero marginal cost
- Multiple marketplaces provide distribution

### Why Now?
- AI tools (Canva AI, Midjourney, ChatGPT) have matured enough for quality template creation
- MuteLab already has Etsy experience (4 Google Sheets products from 1K Challenge)
- Digital products = true passive income (sell once, deliver infinitely)

### Why It's Harder Than It Looks
- Market is flooded post-YouTube-guru explosion (2023-2024)
- Etsy's GMV declining 3 years straight ($13.4B → $12.5B)
- 8.1M active sellers competing for attention
- AI disclosure requirements add friction
- 40-60% of listings get ZERO sales ever

## 4. Product Strategy

### 4.1 Phase 1: Google Sheets Templates (Month 1-3)

**Why start here:** We already have 4 products + experience. Less saturated than Canva. AI handles logic/formulas well. Higher average prices.

Products to create:
- Budget trackers (personal, wedding, business)
- Inventory management sheets
- Project management templates
- Financial dashboards (investment, savings, debt payoff)
- Content calendars
- Habit trackers
- Meal planners with grocery lists
- **Target:** 50-80 products

### 4.2 Phase 2: Notion Templates (Month 2-5)

**Why:** Growing market, less saturated, tech-forward audience willing to pay more.

Products to create:
- Life dashboards
- Student planners
- Business management suites
- Content planning systems
- Finance trackers
- Reading/book trackers
- **Target:** 50-80 products

### 4.3 Phase 3: Printable Planners & Organization (Month 3-8)

**Why:** Massive volume category, good for Pinterest marketing, seasonal demand.

Products to create:
- Annual/monthly/weekly planners
- Goal setting worksheets
- Budget printables
- Cleaning schedules
- Fitness/wellness trackers
- Kids' activity sheets
- **Target:** 100-150 products

### 4.4 Phase 4: Social Media & Canva Templates (Month 5-12)

**Why:** Higher prices for bundles, but most saturated — enter last with differentiated designs.

Products to create:
- Instagram story/post templates by niche (real estate, coaching, restaurants)
- Pinterest pin templates
- Presentation decks
- Media kit templates
- **Target:** 50-100 products

### Total Catalog Target: 250-410 products by Month 12

## 9. Risk Mitigation

|------|----------|------------|
| Etsy AI policy tightens | HIGH | Human curation layer; build own website as backup |
| Market saturation worsens | HIGH | Focus on under-served niches (Google Sheets, Notion); avoid oversaturated (Canva) |
| Low sales velocity | MEDIUM | Pinterest + blog for external traffic; don't rely on Etsy SEO alone |
| Quality issues at scale | MEDIUM | Cap production at 2-3 quality products/day; maintain review standards |
| Platform fee increases | MEDIUM | Diversify to Gumroad + own website; build direct audience |
| Account suspension | LOW-MED | Follow all policies; disclose AI use; maintain quality |

## 11. Decision: Go / No-Go

### ✅ GO — With Conditions

1. **Position as side income stream** — NOT primary MuteLab focus
2. **Start with Google Sheets** (our existing strength) — NOT mass-produced AI slop
3. **Quality over quantity** — 2-3 excellent products/day, not 5 mediocre ones
4. **Realistic expectations** — $30-80K/yr target, not $1M
5. **Time-boxed validation** — If <$500/mo by Month 4, reduce effort
6. **Multi-channel from day 1** — Etsy + Gumroad + Pinterest (skip Shopee)

### Why Not "Full Go"?
The deep dive revealed this is a **good but not great** opportunity. The market is oversaturated, the original revenue math was fantasy, and AI quality has limits. MuteKit should be a revenue supplement, not a primary business thesis.

*"Revenue that compounds beats revenue that churns. MuteKit is slow money — and slow money is fine, as long as you don't mistake it for fast money."*
